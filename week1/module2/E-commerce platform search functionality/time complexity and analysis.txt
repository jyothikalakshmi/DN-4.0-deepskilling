step 1: understand asymptotic notation

Big O notation is used to describe the time or space complexity of an algorithm in terms of input size n.
It helps in selecting the most efficient algorithm for a given problem.
Examples:
O(1) – Constant time
O(n) – Linear time
O(log n) – Logarithmic time
O(n²) – Quadratic time

Linear Search:
Best case: O(1) -> When the element is found at the beginning.
Average case: O(n) ->Element is in the middle.
Worst case: O(n) -> Element is at the end or not present.

Binary Search (on sorted array):
Best case: O(1) -> Element is at the middle.
Average case: O(log n) ->Half of the array is eliminated at each step.
Worst case: O(log n) -> Element is not present after log n steps.


step 4:Analysis

Comparison:

 Linear Search:
  Best: O(1), Average: O(n), Worst: O(n)
  Works on unsorted data but slow for large inputs.

 Binary Search:
  Best: O(1), Average/Worst: O(log n)
  Requires sorted data but is much faster and efficient.

conclusion: For an e-commerce platform, binary search is more efficient and suitable due to its speed and scalability.
