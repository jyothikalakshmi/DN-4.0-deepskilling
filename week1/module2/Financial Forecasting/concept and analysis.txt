step 1: concept of Recursion
Recursion is a process where a function calls itself to solve smaller parts of the same problem.
It continues until it reaches a base case (a condition where it stops calling itself).

How Recursion Simplifies Problems?
-It breaks a big problem into smaller, easier subproblems.
-It is useful for problems with repeating patterns.

step 4: Analysis
Time Complexity:
- The recursive algorithm has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of remaining years to forecast.
- Each recursive call reduces the years by one, and performs a constant amount of work.

Optimization:
Instead of recursion, we can:
-->Use iteration (loop):
We can replace recursion with a loop that repeatedly multiplies the value for each period.
This avoids many function calls and reduces memory usage.
-->Apply the direct formula:
We can directly calculate the future value using the formula:
!future_value=initial_value√ó(1+growth_rate)^n! 
This gives the result in one step, without needing loops or recursion.
